I've gotten many inquiries about how I make them, especially around the card animations, so I'm going to try to extract the generic parts of these games into a library for manipulating cards. Right now I'm not sure whether I'll use images or SVG for the library, 

The card deck images are made by Nicu Buculei, and are in the public domain (found on openclipart.org).

The plan right now is to just get a basic library out that can move cards, maybe rotate them and drag and drop. If you have anything else you'd like just contact me and I'll see what I can do.
